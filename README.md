# Boltkeeper



Hi! I'm Alterion. You might remember me from such mods as Signature Preservation, and future mods I'm sure to have done by the time you see this!

Have you ever been in the heat of battle, getting pummeled by a Werewolf, trying to shoot them down from afar using your Crossbow, and realise you're almost out of health? What happens then, do you put your Crossbow away, dropping all your arrows back in your bag, to chug a potion or eat a Kebab, only to have to reload the darn thing again? 

Well boy, do I have good news for you! With Boltkeeper, our patented arrow locking system keeps those bolts secure into place as you throw your Crossbow on your back, in your bag, in a chest, or wherever your fancy brings you. No longer will you fumble with your arrows, drop them on the floor, and curse your forge of the misfortune of these darn Crossbows being so fragile and finicky.

Go ahead, install it now! It works on every Crossbow you have, guaranteed or your entire money back, in triplicate! Don't double check that math, boys. Just install the mod, you have my personal promise you'll love it.
